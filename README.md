# Module-12-Challenge
Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. The reason is that healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. For this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
